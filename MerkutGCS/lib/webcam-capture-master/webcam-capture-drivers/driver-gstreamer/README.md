# webcam-capture-driver-gstreamer

This is capture driver which gives Webcam Capture API possibility to use
[GStreamer 0.10+](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gstreamer010.html)
as a middleware accessing webcam devices (build-in or USB enabled).

**NOTE**: This capture driver is **only** for GStreamer 0.10+. With GStramer 1.0+ you have to use
[webcam-capture-driver-gst1](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/driver-gst1)
instead!

It has been designed to work with Windows and Linux **only**. To make use of it user have to 
[download](http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/) GStreamer application installer 
on Windows or use _apt-get_, _yum_ or other packages manager to install it on Linux.

Currently supported GStreamer version is 0.10.x, so make sure you are installing
the correct one! It is **not** compatible with GStreamer 1.0 and above!
