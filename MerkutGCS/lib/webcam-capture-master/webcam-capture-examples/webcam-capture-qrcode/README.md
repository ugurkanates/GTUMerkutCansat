# Webcam Capture QR Code Reader Example

This example show how to read QR and bar codes with Webcam Capture.
 
## What Is This

This example show how to process QR and bar codes with your webcam using 
[Webcam Capture](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture) 
project together with awesome [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) library.

Youtube video demonstrating how it is working is [available here](http://youtu.be/JLUJWgveEco). 

### Screenshoots:

First I took a picture of some sample QR code I found on Google 
([link](http://www.google.pl/imgres?um=1&hl=pl&client=firefox-a&sa=N&tbo=d&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&biw=1366&bih=552&tbm=isch&tbnid=ZnVvKF0A2BGNTM:&imgrefurl=http://www.qrstuff.com/&docid=1A-zeI71ulZS1M&imgurl=http://www.qrstuff.com/images/sample.png&w=3000&h=3000&ei=yLSwUNTdCIOC4gS1xIGIBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=154&vpy=141&dur=1160&hovh=225&hovw=225&tx=124&ty=78&sig=117284320547613276213&page=1&tbnh=149&tbnw=159&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:87))
and then put it opposite to my build-in PC web camera.

In the application window webcam image is displayed on the left side, and on the right
side there is a text area containing QR code data. In this case this is just a link
to the web page from where I took my QR code example.
