This simple example show how to use painter interface and default painter 
to mark located face, which has been found using awesome [OpenIMAJ](http://www.openimaj.org/)
framework.
 
## What Is This

This example presents how to use custom painter with conjunction of default one to alter
image displayed in `WebcamPanel` component.

In this example I used Haar Cascade from [OpenIMAJ](http://www.openimaj.org/) to detect faces.
