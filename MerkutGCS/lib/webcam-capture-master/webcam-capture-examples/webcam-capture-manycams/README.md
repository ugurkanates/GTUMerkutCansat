# Webcam Capture Many Cameras Example

This example proves that displaying image from multiple web cameras at once is
practically possible. This example will work with only one camera too, but in
general, it will use all cameras you have connected to your PC. To perform this
test I had to connect [Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000](https://www.google.com/search?q=Microsoft+LifeCam+VX-1000&tbm=isch)
camera to my laptop USB port. 

Just a not:

This is very interesting. I found that build-in camera initialization in my 
case (HP HD webcam) requires about 8 seconds for camera to be ready, and USB 
is ready in less than 1 second.
